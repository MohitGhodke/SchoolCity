# üéØ TO FIX THE SCHOOL DISPLAY ISSUE:

## Steps to Use Your Beautiful School PNG:

1. **Save your school image**: 
   - Right-click on the school image you shared earlier
   - Save it as `school.png` 
   - Place it in this exact folder: `src/assets/images/school.png`

2. **The file should be named exactly**: `school.png` (not school.jpg, school.jpeg, etc.)

3. **Refresh the page** after placing the PNG file

## Current Issue:
The rendering service is trying to load `assets/images/school.png` but the file doesn't exist yet, so it's falling back to the old graphics drawing code.

## Once you place the PNG:
- The beautiful isometric school building will appear instead of the brown graphics
- No more drawn shapes - just your beautiful PNG image!
- The school will be placed exactly where you click on the grid

## File Structure Should Look Like:
```
src/
  assets/
    images/
      school.png  ‚Üê Your beautiful school image goes here!
```
