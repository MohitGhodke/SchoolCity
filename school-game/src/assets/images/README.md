# School PNG Image Placeholder

This file indicates where your school PNG image should be placed.

## Instructions:
1. Save the attached school PNG image as 'school.png' in this directory
2. The image will be automatically loaded and displayed on the grid where schools are placed
3. No graphics drawing needed - just pure PNG image rendering!

## File Path:
Place your school.png image at: `src/assets/images/school.png`

The rendering service will automatically:
- Load your PNG image when the scene starts
- Display it at the correct grid positions where schools are built
- Scale it appropriately to fit the grid tiles
- Handle proper layering and positioning
